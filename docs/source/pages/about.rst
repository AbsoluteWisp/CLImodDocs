| CLImod is a private Minecraft coremod that adds additional functionality to the game's chat
| Due to the nature of CLImod being a coremod (and thus containing substantial portions of Minecraft code), I cannot legally release the client.

The public parts of CLImod are available on my GitHub, though.

dotCLI (or .cli) is the command line interface developed for CLImod.  

| dotcommands (or .commands) are commands recognized by dotCLI.
| They're named after their default prefix `.`
